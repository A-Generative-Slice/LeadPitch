# 🦅 LeadPitch: Hyper-Personalized Outreach (Cloud Edition)

**Turning cold leads into warm conversations using AI that actually "gets it."**

LeadPitch is an automated sales assistant that lives in your cloud. It generates personalized, human-sounding pitches using **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and sends them via your own Gmail—avoiding spam filters and ensuring 100% authenticity.

## 🏎️ New Workflow: "Full Pilot"
We've moved beyond manual scripts. LeadPitch now runs on **GitHub Actions**, meaning it works while you sleep.

- **Cloud-Native Automation**: Runs every hour (or manually) via GitHub Actions.
- **🔍 Auto-Diagnostic**: Built-in secret verification ensures your keys are always set correctly.
- **💾 Real-Time Sync**: Every email sent is immediately synced back to `clients.csv` in your repository.
- **🛡️ Safety First**: Integrated token limits and "human-like" delays (20-60s) keep your accounts safe.
